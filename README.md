This README will contain instructions intended for the Earth Sciences students (Hi Guys) to be able to get this app onto a phone /
tablet for their demo, taking a pre-built .apk file and installing it on an android device (having enabled developer options). 

Pre-Built APK installation method.

1. Ensure that developer options are enabled on the device. 
http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html has instructions about what needs to be enabled and how to make developer 
settings appear if they are not visible. 
Also http://www.androidcentral.com/allow-app-installs-unknown-sources

2. Download the KillhopeTeam4.apk from https://www.dropbox.com/s/eyjevznecp5fxkx/KillhopeTeam4.apk?dl=0 , (last built 21/04/2015)
either onto the phone or a PC.

3. If you downloaded the apk on a PC, either use file transfer from the PC or emailing the file as an attachment to get it onto 
the android device.

4. Navigate to the .apk file on the device (probably in your downloads folder, or whatever folder you put it in from the PC 
via file transfer)

5. Tap the file and the application should install.
